# Homework
Homework 6 was to further our understanding of classes, and BNF's. we would take in a string, and return the parsed value. 
for example a = 5 + 2. it would return 7. 
we can then do a + (4 * 2) - 1 and it would return 14.

Homework 9 was to expose us to Haskell and to deepen our understanding of recursion.

Homework 12 was to give us experience in go using threads, hashing, and recursion.
